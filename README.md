# Mini Project: Shell Scripting for Environment Management

In this mini project, I learned how to use **shell scripting** to manage different infrastructure environments by leveraging **environment variables** and **conditional logic**.  

I created and executed a script (`aws_cloud_manager.sh`) that could run for **testing**, **production**, and **local** environments, showing me how the same script can be adapted for multiple use cases by simply passing arguments.  

This helped me understand the importance of **automation**, **consistency**, and **flexibility** in managing cloud resources, as well as how scripts can **simplify environment setup** and **reduce manual errors**.  

Overall, it gave me a practical foundation in scripting for **infrastructure management**.
